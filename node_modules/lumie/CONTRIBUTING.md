# Contributing to Lumie

🙏🏼 Thank you for taking the time to contribute to Lumie!

Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Alex-Levacher/Lumie/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

## How to contribute

### Improve documentation

Typo corrections, error fixes, better explanations, more examples, etc. Open issues for things that could be improved. Feel free to even improve this document. You can use the [`docs` label](https://github.com/Alex-Levacher/Lumie/labels/docs) to find out what others have suggested!

### Improve issues

Sometimes reported issues lack information, are not reproducible, or are even plain invalid. Help us out to make them easier to resolve. Handling issues takes a lot of time that we could rather spend on fixing bugs and adding features.

### Give feedback on issues

We're always looking for more opinions on discussions in the issue tracker. It's a good opportunity to influence the future direction of the project.

The [`question` label](https://github.com/Alex-Levacher/Lumie/labels/question) is a good place to find ongoing discussions.

### Submit new ideas

If you see some useful features that are missing, feel free to create an issue with the label `feature request`.

### Write code

You can use issue labels to discover issues you could help us out with!

- [`feature request` issues](https://github.com/Alex-Levacher/Lumie/labels/feature%20request) are features we are open to including
- [`bug` issues](https://github.com/Alex-Levacher/Lumie/labels/bug) are known bugs we would like to fix

You may find an issue is assigned, or has the [`assigned` label](https://github.com/Alex-Levacher/Lumie/labels/assigned). Please double-check before starting on this issue because somebody else is likely already working on it

### Submitting an issue

- Search the issue tracker before opening an issue
- Ensure you're using the latest version of Lumie
- Use a descriptive title
- Include as much information as possible like:
  - Steps to reproduce the issue
  - Error message
  - Lumie version

### Submitting a pull request

- Non-trivial changes are often best discussed in an issue first, to prevent you from doing unnecessary work
- Try making the pull request from a [topic branch](https://github.com/dchelimsky/rspec/wiki/Topic-Branches) if it is of crucial importance
- Use a descriptive title for the pull request and commits ( use [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/) in your commit messages )
